# homebridge-ledstrip-bledom

> Fork of [@bjclopes/homebridge-ledstrip-bledom](https://github.com/bjclopes/homebridge-ledstrip-bledom), updated to use [@stoprocent/noble](https://github.com/stoprocent/noble), with the bugs identified in `ble-harness/GAPS.md` fixed, and made compatible with Homebridge 2.

This plugin let you control RGB Bluetooth-enabled "ELK-BLEDOM" LED light strips, that are compatible with the Lotus Lantern app.

Control On/Off, Hue, Saturation and Brightness.

## Prerequisite
You need to have a bluetooth device. Check using `hcitool dev` command. You may also need root access with Homebridge

To run without root access, go to homebridge terminal and type ```sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)```

This command must be re-run any time the Node binary changes — typically after a Node version upgrade.

## Installation

`npm i @sasha-borodin/homebridge-ledstrip-bledom`

From version 2.0.11, the plugin is being run in a child bridge and, as a fail-safe, the child bridge restarts if the peripheral becomes unreacheable.

## Configuration
```js
{
    "accessory": "LedStrip", // Dont change
    "name": "LED", // Accessory name
    "uuid": "be320202f8e8" // BLE device UUID
}
```

To find your device uuid, use `hcitool lescan`, grab the device uuid, remove all ':' and use lowercase alpha characters

The new configuration parameters are based on the work of [user154lt](https://github.com/user154lt) on the project [ELK-BLEDOM-Command-Util](https://github.com/user154lt/ELK-BLEDOM-Command-Util).
